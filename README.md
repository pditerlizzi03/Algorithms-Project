# Project Name - DrinKings
DrinKings is a platform that will help you enjoy your parties in the best way possible.

The main function of our platform is:

It allows their users to know how much alcohol they should drink over the night so that they can enjoy their parties in the best way possible. It takes some body characteristics of the user and it estimates how much they should drink depending on the type of alcoholic beverage they want to consume.

# How to Install and Run the Program
To be able to run our program, make sure you have the following things installed:
- You should have PyCharm or any other platform that allows you to run python code.
- There are not any additional libraries or packages that need to be installed.

# How to Use the Program
1. The user is going to be asked to create a profile as soon as it enters the platform.
- First and last name
- Email address
- Password
2. The user will be asked what type of alcoholic drink is he or she willing to drink tonight. The user can choose from the following(if he or she doesn't want any drink they can just press enter):
- Whiskey 
- Rum 
- Vodka 
- Tequila 
- Gin
- Orujo 
- Coñac 
- Fernet 
- Soju 
- Ginjinha
3. The user will be asked what type of shot does he or she willing to drink tonight. The user can choose from the following:
- Jaggermeister
- Limoncello
- Tequila
- Grand Marnier
- Brandy
- Schnapps
- Aguardiente 
- Fireball
- Absenta
- Pisco
4. The user will be asked what type of beer does he or she willing to drink tonight. The user can choose from the following:
- Corona
- Heineken
- Weidmann
- Mahou
- Budweiser
- La Salve
- Estrella Galicia
- Amstel
- Stella Artois
- Pilsen
5. The user will be asked what type of wine does he or she willing to drink tonight. The user can choose from the following:
- Cabernet Sauvignon
- Ribera del Duero
- Pinot Noir
- Albariño
- Malbec
- Rioja
- Tempranillo
- Pago de los Capellanes
- Marqués the Murrieta
- Izadi Larrosa Rosé
6. The user will be asked what type of champagne does he or she willing to drink tonight. The user can choose from the following:
- GH Mumm
- Moet&Chandon
- Bollinger
- Veuve Cliquot
- Nicolas Feuillate
- Laurent-Perrier
- Don Perignon
- Pommery
- Pipe-Heidsieck
7. The user will be asked what type of shot does he or she willing to drink tonight. The user can choose from the following:
- Moscow Mule
- Margarita
- Mojito
- Blue Lagoon
- Paloma
- Dry Martini
- Piña Colada
8. After choosing all of the types of alcoholic beverages, the program will show the user which ones he or she chose and what are the units for each drink. Each alcoholic beverage has a number of units assigned depending the quantity (%) of alcohol that it has.
9. The the user is going to be asked to complete a small questionnaire regarding with questions like:
- What is your age?
- What is your weight (kg)?
- How many calories have you consumed today?
10. The program is going to get these answers, preform a calculation and display how many alcohol units you should consume tonight. 
11. Then, the program is going to ask the user to select one of the drinks he has previously chosen and subtract the number of units that that drink has from the overall units that you should consume in the night. This is going to repeat until your total units are over; then you will know when you should stop consuming alcohol.
# Extra information about the code 
To carry out our project we used two types of algorithms:
- Hash Tables: A data structure which stores data in an associative manner. In a hash table, data is stored in an array format, where each data value has its own unique index value. We used hash tables to store the data of the alcoholic beverages and the alcohol volume of each one.
- Recursion: A common mathematical and programming concept. It means that a function calls itself. This has the benefit of meaning that you can loop through data to reach a result. We used recursion to make the code simplier and to make the solutions clearer.
